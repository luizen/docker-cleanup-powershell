## What
Powershell script for cleaning up containers and images.

Instead, it focus is
  * Stopping all containers
  * Deleting all containers
  * Deleting all images

## Steps
1. Open PowerShell
2. *cd* to the folder where the script has been downloaded to
3. Type `.\docker-kill-all.ps1` and hit *ENTER*
